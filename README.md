The program asks the user to choose one of three categories for types of food. Once the user inputs their choice, the program randomly generates a choice from the ten possible answers from their selected category. The program runs as intended and allows me to choose whether I want to replay it or end the program. The data validation makes it so if I input a value other than the strings it asks for, it sends me to the option of wanting to play again or not. Good job!
